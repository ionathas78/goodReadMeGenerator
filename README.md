# goodReadMeGenerator
Unit 09 Node.js and ES6+ Homework: Good README Generator

> Because if you want a good README, you've just gotta make a README generator yourself.

I wanted my readmes to be a little more structured and intentional, so it was time to code a README maker--after all,
the best way to learn something is to program it. I searched through a number of articles to find some common elements
that make up a great readme and tried to implement those through an interactive command-line interface using Inquirer.
It was important to me that the app should put an emphasis on screen shots.
I wanted to make a team section that would look up teammates' profiles on GitHub and fetch their avatars, but I didn't
have time to incorporate that. Maybe later.

## User Story

```
AS A programmer
I WANT to write effective, solid ReadMes
SO THAT people will grasp my projects with a short glance
```

```
GIVEN THAT someone reads my README
WHEN I see the top section
THEN I want a strong overview with images to look at
WHEN I look through the file
THEN I want to see consistent, thoughtful structure
WHEN I get to the end
THEN I want to see my info and a line indicating the file was autogenerated by my program.
```

## Technologies
- Node.js / fs module
- Inquirer
- Axios


## Getting Started
Be sure to run an npm install to catch the dependencies.
```
npm install
```
The program needs the Inquirer and Axios modules to function.


## Usage
```
node index.js
OR
node index.js <output_filename.md>
```
You can run the app with a single command line argument indicating the name of the output file. The program uses
fs.writeFile() and **does not** prompt for confirmation in its current build, so be careful not to overwrite anything
important!
Once the app runs, it'll prompt you for your GitHub username. It then runs an API query in the background while you're 
answering questions to retrieve your avatar, so be sure to spell your username correctly.
After that, you'll be faced with an interminable series of prompts regarding various details about your project. Don't
worry, you can always leave one or two of these fields blank if you like. If you leave more than three fields blank, though,
I can't guarantee your computer won't melt.
